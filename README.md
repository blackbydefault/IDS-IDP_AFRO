----About This Project----

AFRO (Aware, Formal Reactive Operative) is a Discord Bot developed to enhance server security and provide real-time protection against malicious activities. 
Built using the Java Discord API (JDA), AFRO is designed to be a reliable and efficient security solution for Discord communities.

Key Features:
Threat Detection & Prevention: Identifies and blocks malicious users, server nuking attempts, and raid activities in real time.

Lockdown Mechanisms: Enables swift server lockdowns to protect against ongoing threats and secure server integrity.

Moderator Alerts: Sends instant notifications to moderators, ensuring quick and effective responses to potential security breaches.

API Rate Limiting: Implements rate-limiting strategies to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, maintaining optimal server performance.

AFRO reflects my interest to solving real-world challenges in digital security and showcases my knowledge in Java, API integrations, and scalable software design. 
Created by Leroy A. (My IRL name), this project is a first step towards demonstrating my passion for both software development and cybersecurity concepts.
